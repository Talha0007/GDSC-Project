Night Patrolling Robot
This project involves building a robot that can patrol an area at night, using AI-powered image recognition and navigation capabilities. The robot is designed to detect and respond to potential security threats, and can be controlled remotely via a mobile app or web interface.

Components
The night patrolling robot is built using the following components:

ESP32 microcontroller
Motors
ESP32 cam
4 motors controller
FTDI adapter
AI-powered image recognition and navigation software
Setup
To set up the night patrolling robot, follow these steps:

Clone the project repository from Github to your local machine.
Connect the ESP32 microcontroller, motors, ESP32 cam, 4 motors controller, and FTDI adapter to your development environment.
Install the necessary libraries and dependencies as specified in the project documentation.
Build and deploy the image recognition and navigation software to the ESP32 microcontroller.
Test the robot's functionality and make any necessary adjustments.
Usage
To use the night patrolling robot, follow these steps:

Power on the robot and connect to it via your mobile app or web interface.
Use the app or interface to navigate the robot to the desired location.
The robot will use its AI-powered image recognition software to detect potential security threats and respond accordingly.
Monitor the robot's progress and make any necessary adjustments as needed.
